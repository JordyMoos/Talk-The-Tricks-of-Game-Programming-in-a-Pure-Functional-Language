						I have been programming since about the age of 12.<br>
						Well messing around with stuff on the computer.<br>
						Can not really call that programming I suppose.

				<section>

					<aside class="notes">
						Anyways from the start I tried to apply programming to something game related.<br>
						Like we build this zelda themed browser game inspired by the game criminals.<br>
						This was actually version 2. You should have seen version 1

						And a few year ago when Elder Scrolls Online came out I created an Action House addon

				<section data-background-image="./img/elder-scrolls-online-rich.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						Which made me pretty rich which is nice.<br>
						Well in-game of course.

				<section data-background-image="./img/game-books.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						Even though I'm a web backend developer. I really enjoy reading books about game programming.<br>
						Games can be really big and complicated programs. And I like reading about how stuff is done.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./img/led-table.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						This is building up towards where the talk is all about<br>
						I wanted to build a led table like this for years.<br>
						So I could make games and play them together on my table<br>
						Which I thought would be really cool.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./img/think.jpeg">
					<aside class="notes">
						But the problem with me is that I always go for the challenge.<br>
						When the challenges are done I'm getting bored and not really interested in finishing the product<br>

				<section data-background-image="./img/challenge-2.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						And I will find new challenges elsewhere

				<section>
					<img src="./img/previous-gametables.png" class="stretch plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						This is a bit problematic..<br>
						I kinda build the game engine code a few times already<br>
						But I never build the table

				<section data-background-image="./img/genius-idea.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						One day I had this genius idea.<br>
						What if I would invite someone to join me.<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./img/build-together.jpeg">
					<aside class="notes">
						I found the perfect victim with the same level of enthusiasm.<br>
						But with more creativity and less years of programming experience<br>
						Which I thought would be great so we would find our own challenges in the project.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./img/promise.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						We decided to create it in python with raspberry pi<br>
						The victim had a busy time and could not start the project. Vacation or something. Can not really remember<br>
						Knowing me that I would have finished most of it before dawn we kinda promised not to look into python or the raspberry pi in the mean time.

				<section data-background-image="./img/energic.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						I was like full of energy to finally really make the game table.<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./img/game-programming.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						While python and the leds where out of the question. And still wanting to do something with this energy<br>
						I decided to pick the most difficult game from a list of games I would like for the table<br>
						And wanted to make that in Elm.<br>
					</aside>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/boulder-dash-nes.jpg" class="stretch plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						I though if I could make Boulder Dash in Elm. Then I can probably make any of them in python<br>
						Who have played this game?<br>
						The idea of the game is pretty simple<br> You are this little hero<br>
						And you need to collect the diamonds<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-logo.png" class="stretch plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Every game programming book I have is based on object oriented programming. Most of them in c++ but other languages like Java follow the same patterns offcourse.<br>
						Those language are object oriented after all.<br>
						I was learning the functional paradim and played with Elm for a few year.<br>
						And I wanted to try to see how it goes. To learn from an experiment.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./img/formula-1-chinese-gp-2019-afte-2.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						The game we are going to talk about is this recreating of Boulder Dash in Elm.<br>
						And for the code sample to be understandable we should take a crash course of Elm.

						But I did not promise I could not do some game programming.<br>
						Its like my goto place. I can never promise not to do that<br>

						We had this big list of games. And I was like if I can make the most difficult game in the list. In a language or paradigm which is not really accustomed for game programming.
						Than I could make every game in python.

						And that is how it started. I took boulder dash because of my nostalgic love for the game. And Elm because I was playing with it for some time.
						And its a functional language. While all books i read about game programming. Assumed an object oriented language like c++
