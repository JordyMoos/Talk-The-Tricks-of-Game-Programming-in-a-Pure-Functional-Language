						Can not really call that programming I suppose.

						Anyways from the start I tried to apply programming to something game related.<br>
						Like we build this zelda themed browser game inspired by the game criminals.<br>
						This was actually version 2. You should have seen version 1

				<section data-background-image="./img/game-books.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						Even though I'm a web backend developer. I really enjoy reading books about game programming.<br>
						Games can be really big and complicated programs. And I like reading about how stuff is done.

				<section data-background-image="./img/led-table.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						This is building up towards where the talk is all about<br>
						I wanted to build a led table like this for years.<br>
						So I could make games and play them together on my table<br>
						Which I thought would be really cool.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./img/think.jpeg">
					<aside class="notes">
						But the problem with me is that I always go for the challenge.<br>
						When the challenges are done I'm getting bored and not really interested in finishing the product<br>

				<section data-background-image="./img/challenge-2.png">

				<section>
					<img src="./img/previous-gametables.png" class="stretch plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						This is a bit problematic..<br>
						I kinda build the game engine code a few times already<br>
						But I never build the table

				<section data-background-image="./img/genius-idea.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						One day I had this genius idea.<br>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/build-together.jpeg" class="stretch plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						I found the perfect victim with the same level of enthusiasm.<br>
						But with more creativity and less years of programming experience<br>
						Which I thought would be great so we would find our own challenges in the project.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./img/promise.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						We decided to create it in python with raspberry pi<br>
						The victim had a busy time and could not start the project. Vacation or something. Can not really remember<br>
						Knowing me that I would have finished most of it before dawn we kinda promised not to look into python or the raspberry pi in the mean time.

				<section data-background-image="./img/energic.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						I was like full of energy to finally really make the game table.<br>

				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./img/game-programming.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						While python and the leds where out of the question. And still wanting to do something with this energy<br>

					<aside class="notes">
						I though if I could make Boulder Dash in Elm, a pure functional language. Then I can probably make any of them in python<br>
						Who have played this game?<br>
						The idea of the game is pretty simple<br> You are this little hero<br>
						And you need to collect the diamonds

					<aside class="notes">
						Remember we are building a game for a 12 by 12 led table. This is all the graphics you can get.<br>
						The green dot in the middle is our hero. Brown is dirt which we can walk through.<br>
						Grey are rocks which fall down<br> Blue are the diamonds we need to collect<br>
						And red is going to hurt us ;(

					<aside class="notes">
						When I showed this, people where like mhe.<br>
						So I added a image renderer to make it visually a bit more appealing
					</aside>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-logo.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Every game programming book I have is based on object oriented programming. Most of them in c++ but other languages like Java follow the same patterns.<br>
						I was learning the functional paradigm and played with Elm for a few year.<br>
						And I wanted to try to see how it would be to create a game in Elm.<br>
						To learn from an experiment.<br>
						Who has used elm?
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./img/formula-1-chinese-gp-2019-afte-2.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						To better understand how the game written and to understand the samples we are going to take a crash course into Elm.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-logo.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Elm is a bit different then most of the languages out there.<br>
						Which sometimes scare people off.<br>
						But I actually find Elm one of the easiest languages to learn.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Pure Functional language</li>
						<li class="fragment">Statically Typed</li>
						<li class="fragment">Strongly Typed</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Some of the characteristics of Elm is that it is a Pure Functional language, Its statically and stronly typed.<br>
						Which allows the compiler to complain when I'm doing things wrong again<br>
						But its complains are often so clear that you can learn a lot from the compiler
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-syntax-01.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						A simple function in elm looks like this<br>
						We have the name of the function `add`<br>
						The arguments `x` and `y`<br>
						And then on the right side of the equal sign is the body of the function
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-syntax-02.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Now everything in Elm is typed and you can annotate the function with its types<br>
						Here we say the type of `add` is. We take a number, and a number.<br>
						And then we will return a number.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-syntax-03.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Applying functions is done by spaces.<br>
						And function arguments are also separated by spaces<br>
						Therefor we call `add` like this
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-syntax-04.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Everything in Elm is curried. Therefor you can call a function with less then all arguments<br>
						And you will get back a function that requires the remaining arguments.<br>
						Calling `add` with just `5` will give us a function that requires another argument before computing a result
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./img/architecture.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						So far Elm is not that different. At least to languages like Haskell.<br>
						It is compared to javascript hehe<br>
						What Elm also has is some kind of architecture
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-architecture-1.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						In Elm you always have a Model, which is the state of your application<br>
						update which is a function that creates new states<br>
						And a view. Which is a function to visualize your state.<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-architecture-2.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						In this case we define to be just an integer
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-architecture-3.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						To update your state, or to create a new model, you need to have some intend<br>
						These you define as messages in Elm.<br>
						This example is a little counter which you can increment and decrement
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-architecture-4.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						A produced message together with your model will be given to the defined `update` function.<br>
						Which in return will return a new model<br>
						As we can see in the type of the update function as well.<br>
						Given a msg and a model will return a model
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-architecture-5.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						To visualize your state. You have the view function.<br>
						Which received the model and returns some sort of html.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-architecture.jpg" class="stretch plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						To visualize the architecture in one picture<br>
						The puppets and their orientation is your Model<br>
						The theater is the result of the view<br>
						The kids are producing messages<br>
						Which Mister `Update` received and it adjust the model as requested<br>

				<section data-background-image="./img/movie-scene.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						When you create games you can look at it as if you are directing movies.<br>
						This is the scene on a movie. Or a scene in your game.<br>
						And those are Actors. Which will be Actors in our game as well.<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/actor-scene-1.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						To put it into perspective for the boulder dash game<br>
						This is a scene with our hero and an enemy<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/actor-scene-2.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						I did not like the white background therefor I added a background image.<br>
						Makes it look like a game already<br>
						Its a pretty boring game, just those two actors standing there.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./img/time.jpeg">
					<aside class="notes">
						To make the game come alive, you need to add some notion of time
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/game-loop-1.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Which we call the Game Loop<br>
						A very simplistic one is this, update the game, and then sleep for some time<br>
						And keep doing that forever<br>
						Code samples with white background are pseudo code in a C like style<br>
						<br>
						This update function will be called once a second.<br>
						Which you can use to update your game state.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-video="./img/game-loop-1.mp4" data-background-video-muted data-background-size="contain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Now if we let the actors move one tile each update then that will look like this<br>
						I added walls so our update logic can use that to reverse direction
