						Every game programming book I have is based on object oriented programming. Most of them in c++ but other languages like Java follow the same patterns.<br>
						I was learning the functional paradigm and played with Elm for a few year.<br>

						To learn from an experiment.<br>
						Who has used elm?

					<aside class="notes">
						Elm is a bit different then most of the languages out there.<br>
						Which sometimes scare people off.<br>
						But I actually find Elm one of the easiest languages to learn.

				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>Pure Functional language</li>
						<li class="fragment">Statically Typed</li>
						<li class="fragment">Strongly Typed</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Some of the characteristics of Elm is that it is a Pure Functional language, Its statically and stronly typed.<br>
						Which allows the compiler to complain when I'm doing things wrong again<br>
						But its complains are often so clear that you can learn a lot from the compiler
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-syntax-01.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						A simple function in elm looks like this<br>
						We have the name of the function `add`<br>
						The arguments `x` and `y`<br>
						And then on the right side of the equal sign is the body of the function
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-syntax-02.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Now everything in Elm is typed and you can annotate the function with its types<br>
						Here we say the type of `add` is. We take a number, and a number.<br>
						And then we will return a number.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-syntax-03.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Applying functions is done by spaces.<br>
						And function arguments are also separated by spaces<br>
						Therefor we call `add` like this
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-syntax-04.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Everything in Elm is curried. Therefor you can call a function with less then all arguments<br>
						And you will get back a function that requires the remaining arguments.<br>
						Calling `add` with just `5` will give us a function that requires another argument before computing a result
					</aside>

				<section data-background-image="./img/architecture.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						So far Elm is not that different. At least to languages like Haskell.<br>
						It is compared to javascript hehe<br>
						What Elm also has is some kind of architecture
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-architecture-1.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						In Elm you always have a Model, which is the state of your application<br>
						update which is a function that creates new states<br>
						And a view. Which is a function to visualize your state.<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-architecture-2.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						In this case we define to be just an integer
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-architecture-3.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						To update your state, or to create a new model, you need to have some intend<br>
						These you define as messages in Elm.<br>
						This example is a little counter which you can increment and decrement
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-architecture-4.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						A produced message together with your model will be given to the defined `update` function.<br>

						As we can see in the type of the update function as well.<br>
						Given a msg and a model will return a model
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-architecture-5.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						To visualize your state. You have the view function.<br>

					<aside class="notes">
						To visualize the architecture in one picture<br>

					<aside class="notes">
						When you create games you can look at it as if you are directing movies.<br>
						This is the scene on a movie. Or a scene in your game.<br>
						And those are Actors. Which will be Actors in our game as well.<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/actor-scene-1.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						To put it into perspective for the boulder dash game<br>
						This is a scene with our hero and an enemy<br>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/actor-scene-2.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						I did not like the white background therefor I added a background image.<br>
						Makes it look like a game already<br>
						Its a pretty boring game, just those two actors standing there.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-background-image="./img/time.jpeg">
					<aside class="notes">
						To make the game come alive, you need to add some notion of time
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Game Loop</h2>
					<img src="./img/game-loop-1.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Which we call the Game Loop<br>
						A very simplistic one is this, update the game, and then sleep for some time<br>
						And keep doing that forever<br>
						Code samples with white background are pseudo code in a C like style<br>
						<br>
						This update function will be called once a second.<br>
						Which you can use to update your game state.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-state="game-loop-1-section">
					<video id="game-loop-1-video" controls autoplay>
						<source src="./img/game-loop-1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
						Your browser does not support the video tag.
					</video>
					<script>
						$(document).ready(function () {
							Reveal.addEventListener("game-loop-1-section", function () {
								$('#game-loop-1-video').currentTime = 0;
								$('#game-loop-1-video').load();
							}, false);
						});
					</script>
					<aside class="notes">
						Now if we let the actors move one tile each update then that will look like this<br>
						I added walls so our update logic can use that to reverse direction
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/game-loop-2.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						The game moves very slow and we can fix that to lower the sleep time.<br>
						17 milliseconds will give us about 60 updates per second
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/game-loop-3.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Now we are not really calling update every 17ms.<br>
						We forgot to take into account the time it took to run `update`<br>
						If update takes about 10ms then together with sleep we only call update about once in the 27ms<br>
						You can fix that by subtracting the time it took from the sleep
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/game-loop-4.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Another option would be to check how much time has passed since the last update<br>
						And use that as some kind of delta time in update<br>
						That within update you check how much actors must move based on the delta time<br>
						An disadvantage of this is that too much time might have passed. And actor might jump pass walls
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/game-loop-5.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						A safer bet is to have a stable update call. Which makes it unable for your game to make giant loops on slow computers<br>
						If you split the update and view. You can do multiple update ticks in case too much time has passed the last loop.<br>
						To let the game `catch up`. At the cost of drawing the game less frequent. Which we will see as "frame drops"
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
          <img src="./img/elm-game-loop-1.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
            Elm is a pure functional language and asking for the time is an impure operation.<br>
            Time has this habit of changing a lot<br>
            In order to get some time information you need to setup something called "Subscriptions"<br>
            Which allows mechanisms outside of your app to send `Messages` which you can handle in a pure fashion.<br>
            We define a message, setup a subscription to get that message every 17 milliseconds<br>
            And handle the message
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
          <img src="./img/elm-game-loop-2.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
            We are running in the browser and the browser has some mechanism to redraw the screen.<br>
            And to make animations look smoother we can kinda hook into that redraw mechanism<br>
						We can do something similar as we did with time but then based on the browsers animation frame<br>
						This time we get the amount of milliseconds passed instead of a "stable 17ms" like we had with time<br>
						And therefor we should be doing some match instead of calling the update function everytime
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
          <img src="./img/game-loop-5.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Remembering our game loop. We would like to update on a stable 17 millisecond. For as many 17 milliseconds since we did our last loop<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-game-loop-3.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						You do not have for loops in Elm but we can create a List of a certain length and iterate over it<br>
						Which we do with List.repeat<br> We determine how often our game speed has passed and create a list of the same length<br>
						Because we need to update the game based on the previous update. We can fold over our list and use our model as the accumulator<br>
						This will give us the sketched game loop
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-game-loop-4.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						We can improve the game loop by limiting the amount of updates per "view".<br>
						We do this to not make it look like our hero jumped far because of a game hickup<br>
						This is easy by just taking x elements from our repeated list
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-game-loop-5.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Finally we should keep track of how many time we had left. Like 3ms if the timeSinceLast was 20ms.<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-game-loop-6.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						After the `update` function returned our new model, elm will call our view function again<br>
						In which we will render the game
					</aside>

					<h2>Actors</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/actor-component-1.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						A way to have actors is to create the individuals.<br>
						Like we have a Hero and an Enemy<br>
						Which both have an `update` function.<br>
						Which in turn gets called from the main loop
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/actor-component-2.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						You add all the behaviours in those classes like walking and collection diamonds for our hero.<br>
						And walking and killing heroes for the enemy
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/actor-component-3.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						After a while you will end up with more and more actors<br>
						Like a butterfly, which is an AI just like our Enemy but then being super cute instead of trying to kill the hero
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/actor-component-4.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						This goes on and on and you end up with lots of actors which update functions get really big and messy<br>
						Also you will notice you get lots of duplicate behaviour among your actors.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/actor-component-5.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						A solution in the object oriented world could be to introduce some form of inheritance<br>
						Which is actually not really reusable and might give us "Diamonds of deaths"<br>
						Like I have no clue how this update function would look like
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/actor-component-6.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Another more reusable approach would be to put the behavior in separate places, which we called components here<br>
						And assign components to actors. Like our hero has the WalkComponent and CollectComponent or whatever<br>
						And we would give our enemy the KillComponent.<br>
						This way we can easily mix and match components and thereby create new actors with less effort
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Composition over Inheritance</h3>
					<img src="./img/composition-over-inheritance.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						The benefits of Composition over Inheritance<br>
						This is nice because we do not have inheritance in Elm anyway hehe<br>
						Elm can do the composition which we call the Actor Component system<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-actor-component-1.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						In Elm we can create our own type which we call Component<br>
						And Component can by any of those specified options<br>
						Its a bit like an Enum.<br>
						Components can hold data like we give a String to TagComponent to represent the tag name<br>
						And its can also have custom type or type aliases. Like we create some TransformComponentData record with x and y positions for the transform.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-actor-component-2.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Once we have our components we can mix and match them to create actors.<br>
						We define an actor as just a list of components and we create our hero and enemy.<br>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-actor-component-3.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Now a little sidetrack<br>
						ControllerInputComponent and WalkAiComponent kinda do the same thing. They control the actors movement etc<br>
						Those components just do it in their own way, via collected input or some ai logic<br>
						We could group them together under one ControlComponent to make it clearer that you should not have both<br>
						Also you can keep giving data to your types like we give some AiSettings to ControlType

					<h2>Implementing behaviour</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Types in Elm are just data they are not like objects which can have function and behaviour<br>
						With other words, our components do not do anything yet.<br>
						We need to add functions for their behaviours<br>
						Now the fun stuff begins

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-component-implementation-1.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						Here we have a very naive walking implementation for the WalkAiComponent<br>
						Which will just make the actor move to the right<br>
						We receive the actor that holds this component and we will net to fetch the transformComponent from the actor<br>
						Because the transform holds its current position<br>
						After that we will walk one position to the right. Which will create a new transform component<br>
						Which in turn needs to overwrite the current transform component of the actor<br>
						Finally if the actor did not have a transform component then we will return the actor as we received it
					</aside>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-component-implementation-2.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						This function will try to get the TransformComponentData from the actor. But he might not have any therefor we return a Maybe.

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-component-implementation-3.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						And we are in a FP environment therefor here is a more fancy implementation with curring and function composition

				<section>

						walkRight will just create a new TransformData based on the current one but with x increased by one<br>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-component-implementation-5.png" class="plain">
					<aside class="notes">
						After that we need to update the actors transform component which we do by removing the old one and adding the new one<br>
						This concludes the behaviour of the component<br>

				<section>

						Every game tick we would like to iterate over the actors to glue the actor component system with the main loop.<br>
						Because components can change their actor we need to do some folding<br>
						We fold over all the actors and let them call updateActor on each<br>
						Then we update all components on the actor<br>
						And then we will need to update our actor in the accumulator
					</aside>

				<section>
					<img src="./img/elm-component-implementation-7.png" class="plain">

						I have added the actors to our model<br>
						That way we can update the actors each game tick<br>
						Give that function the actors and store the updated actors with the rest of our model, forming a new model<br>
						<br>
						This will actually work and we now have actors moving to the right which have that WalkAiComponent<br>
						It might look like a lot of work but I can tell you.... It will get worse

						After that came the Canvas renderer. Which looked the same as the game looks now<br>
						But it had two issues. One is performace, I had to redraw the whole scene every frame from scratch<br>

						And problem two was that a technique used by the canvas library was depricated and got removed in elm 0.19
